# Data Sources in Urban Informatics
In 2011, Forth et al. described Urban Informatics as a separate field of study. It focuses on three key aspects - place, technology, and people in the context of urban environments. The urban environment is described as a "complex techno-social network; the city only meaningfully exists when a sustained stream of people occupies it." Regarding the technological aspects, the authors outline four dominant trends: ubiquitous computing, the accessibility of real-time information, informed sustainability, and planning based on citizen participation. 

One of the goals of Urban Informatics is to develop communication channels between local authorities and citizens. Moreover, thanks to the gathered information, the citizens can, directly and indirectly, influence the development of the urban area. The communication channels, as understood by Urban Informatics, are omnidirectional. The data is gathered and received through devices that are part of the ubicomp device system. Therefore, the ubicomp system can be understood as a data source. Additional data sources are local governments and online services, including social media. 

## Ubicomp
Mark Weiser first introduced Ubiquitous Computing in 1991. The concept of ubicomp relies on small embedded computers, which communicate together and allow for seamless interaction between users and technology. On the level of cities, the ubiquitous information's impact became the focus of study in a field called Urban Computing. 

In the spirit of ubiquitous computing, there is an emerging field of Participatory Sensing, which enables gathering data from devices of individual users. The design of the participation model focuses on data credibility, security, and privacy protection. One of the applications of Participatory Sensing is the use of the gathered data for urban planning. 

## Open Data
The other prominent source of data are governments and local institutions. The data is commonly released in several open formats, which are further described in a separate section. This data often includes maps, building layouts, terrain models, technical metadata, public transport data, etc. The formats range from generic CSV or SQLite-based to domain-specific DWG, CityGML, etc.   
The data presented earlier are mainly static; some cities also offer real-time information about weather or public transport vehicle locations. 

## Online services
Personal data can also be acquired from social networks or mobile phone carriers. Online platforms usually support geotagging, adding geospatial metadata to the content posted online. The content can be easily queried based on the selected location. Alternatively, the citizens' location can be tracked via their mobile phone directly by carriers using the individual base transceiver stations (BTS).  From the perspective of Urban Informatics, the aforementioned data sources enable creating richer urban area models.
